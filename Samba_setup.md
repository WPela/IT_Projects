**Samba setup**

We will set Samba tool now to share disk which is connected to raspberry. Because I want to reach terminal via my laptop, I will use PuTTY to connect to my raspberry.

Before I connect, I need to know ip of the device. In raspberry terminal ![image](https://github.com/WPela/IT_Projects/assets/62253932/d92868f5-c729-4227-8297-e8e70789f81c), type in *ifconfig* and write down the ip. Till this moment, we do not need to use GUI of the raspberry.

In PuTTY type in ip of the device and press "Open".

Raspberry will ask for user's name and password. *Important* While typing password, you will not see characters appearing - just type in password and press enter.
