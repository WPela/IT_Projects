# Samba setup

We will set Samba tool now to share disk which is connected to raspberry. Because I want to reach terminal via my laptop, I will use PuTTY to connect to my raspberry.

Before I connect, I need to know ip of the device. In raspberry terminal ![image](https://github.com/WPela/IT_Projects/assets/62253932/d92868f5-c729-4227-8297-e8e70789f81c), type in *ifconfig* and write down the ip. Till this moment, we do not need to use GUI of the raspberry.

In PuTTY type in ip of the device and press "Open".

Raspberry will ask for user's name and password. *Important* While typing password, you will not see characters appearing - just type in password and press enter.

Update software using *sudo apt update* command. In case of packages which can be upgraded, additionally use *sudo apt full-upgrade*.

Now we will move to samba. Type in *sudo apt install samba*. In case of questions to install additional elements, pres *y*. Also you will see progress bar on the bottom.

Once done, check status with *sudo systemctl status smbd* command.

Use command *df -h* to check location of the connected disk.

In this case it is /dev/sda1 and I will create new directory using *sudo mkdir /PiServer* command. 

Now map the disk to the directory using *sudo nano /etc/fstab* command and type locations and settings similar to the line on the screenshot.

Reboot Raspberry after that.


Open samba config now *sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf* and add shared directory on the bottom of the page as below:

Restart password with *sudo smbpasswd -a username*.

At the end restart samba *service smbd restart*.

Now, map network drive on you PC using ip adress and name of the shared location e.g. *\\192.168.0.23\PiServer*.
