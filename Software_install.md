After couple minutes you will see information about completed installation and popup to remove sd card.

Put the card into raspberry and connect power source.

Connect raspberry to the computer screen and go through multiple setup screens like language, timezone or user account if you did not set it before.

Installer will ask you if you want to update the software. Press "Next" to update system or "Skip" to leave current version.

At the end restart the system and wait until desktop appears.
